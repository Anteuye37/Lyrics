            We're talking away
            I don't know what
            I'm to say I'll say it anyway
            Today's another day to find you
            Shying away
            I'll be coming for your love, okay?

            Take on me (take on me)
            Take me on (take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day or two

            So needless to say
            I'm odds and ends
            But I'll be stumbling away
            Slowly learning that life is okay
            Say after me
            It's no better to be safe than sorry

            Take on me (take on me)
            Take me on (take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day or two 

            Oh, the things that you say. yeah
            Is it life or
            Just to play my worries away?
            You're all the things I've got to remember
            You're shying away
            I'll be coming for you anyway

            Take on me (take on me)
            Take me on (take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day

            I'll be gone (take on me, take on me) 
            In a day (take on me, take on me)
            (Take on me, take on me)
            (Take on me, take on me)
            (Take on me)
